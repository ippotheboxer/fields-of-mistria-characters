Some data files for Fields of Mistria, used in my Guess-who Mistria game! 
Contains data.json file containing information on characters, image folder containing images of all portraits (from each season, and beach variations for dateable characters) and a background from the starting screen of the game.

If you want to use this data on your own coding project, a star on this repo and link in the README would be appreciated ;)

Happy coding üíñ

  - The children in the game (Luc, Dell, Maple) cannot be given Alcohol or Caffeine related items.

- **beach_filename**: beach portrait image name (only dateable characters have this)

## Images

In the `characters/` folder, there is a folder of each character containing their portraits. Most characters have unique portraits for each season, and dateable characters also have a beach portrait. 
The filenames always start with the name of the season in lowercase: "spring", "summer", "fall", "winter" then followed with "_" and then the undercase name of the character. All files are png format.

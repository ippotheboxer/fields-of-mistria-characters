She wears purple eyeshadow and nail polish which remains consistent throughout the year, with exceptions to her nail polish – she changes colours to pink for Spring, blue for Summer, and white for Fall and Winter.",
    "personality": "Adeline is a hardworking person, who presents herself as a bit of a workaholic. Her passion towards Mistria drives her to focus on her administrative duties, with the downside of often neglecting her personal life and social needs - she is often scolded by the other townsfolk for working too hard. A large part of her values is having a strong community and lasting stability for the townsfolk – this is seen with how often she initiates projects for the town’s renovations after she enlists the player’s help. She also writes reports for the town records so there's documentation for Mistrians of the future. Whilst her work remains a strong source of enjoyment, she enjoys visiting the bathhouse and spending time with Reina and Celine.",
    "story": "Adeline is the daughter of Baron Wiscar and Baroness Linnet and is sister to Eiland. The two of them grew up in Mistria and continued to live there, even after a destructive earthquake ravaged the town of Mistria, which forced her parents to the Capital. Alongside Eiland, the two of them are left to manage what remains of Mistria. Adeline has made it her life's goal to restore the town to its former glory[1]. With this goal in mind, Adeline puts up a request in Mistria’s name, detailing that in return of helping the town, whoever accepts the quest will receive the plot of land just south of the town. This is the request that the player will take on, which starts their journey in Mistria.",
